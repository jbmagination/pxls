! This filter list currently only has one filter, meant to unblock CORS requests containing images on pxls.space.
! This is because some filter lists may block URLs that could likely be used in template URLs - for example, /pxls/*.
! However, some trackers also use /pxls/*, so this filter list is designed to be extremely careful to not unblock 
! those.
!
! While tracking pixels can technically be abused with this filter list on (so your security on other websites may 
! theoretically be at risk by using this), images were specifically unblocked so no other form of tracking could 
! potentially be used.
